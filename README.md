# Virtual Robot Maze Simulator in Rust

Virtual Robot Maze Simulator in Rust: Program a virtual robot to navigate a 2D maze using Rust! Interact with a "black box" API for motor control and sensors, learning basic control algorithms and embedded systems concepts in a fun, hands-on way. Ideal for beginners and aspiring developers.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to teach the basics of the Rust programming language while simulating real-world embedded systems. You'll be coding a virtual robot to navigate a maze by interacting with a black box API that represents motor controls and sensors.

### Key Learning Goals
- **Rust Programming**: Get hands-on experience with Rust syntax, control flow, and core concepts like ownership, borrowing, and error handling.
- **Embedded Systems Concepts**: Understand how to interact with virtual sensors and motors, similar to programming real-world embedded devices.
- **Algorithm Development**: Implement basic control algorithms for the robot to autonomously navigate a 2D maze.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **GitHub Account**: Create an account if you don’t already have one. You can sign up using Google.
- **GitHub Codespaces**: This project is designed to run in GitHub Codespaces, which provides a cloud-based development environment.
- **Rust**: No local installation needed if using Codespaces, but you can install Rust locally if desired. Follow instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Initial Setup
1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account using the "Fork" button at the top of this page.
2. **Open a Codespace**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Code" button, select "Codespaces," and create a new Codespace.
   - This will automatically set up a Rust development environment using the provided `.devcontainer` configuration.

## How to Use This Project
### Basic Tasks
1. **Implement Movement Functions**:
   - Start by coding basic movement functions like `move_forward`, `turn_left`, and `turn_right`.
2. **Read Sensor Data**:
   - Use the provided API to get sensor readings and adjust the robot's movements based on obstacle detection.
3. **Solve the Maze**:
   - Implement a simple maze-solving algorithm (e.g., right-hand rule) to help the robot navigate through the maze.

### Advanced Tasks
- **Implement Speed Control**: Add functionality to adjust the robot's speed.
- **Add Error Handling**: Use Rust's `Result` and `Option` types to handle potential errors from the black box API.
- **Optimize Maze Navigation**: Try more advanced algorithms, like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).
